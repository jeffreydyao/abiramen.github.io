    <p>Hi! If youâ€™re here, that means Iâ€™ve finally got around to fully completing my website! I purchased this domain 10
months ago, mostly neglected it for 9 of those months, or was super indecisive about how I wanted to approach it, and
then finally got around to working on it.</p>

<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
<p>I knew the main feature I wanted to implement was a blog, and that I also wanted some place for a portfolio, while having a relatively unique design compared to most blogs. With this in mind, I quickly threw something together in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<h2 id="making-a-logo">Making a logo</h2>
<p>Iâ€™ve had an idea in my mind to have some kind of ramen logo out of neon lights. After creating a wireframe in Illustrator, and a few Photoshop tutorials on neon glow effects later, Iâ€™ve got a new logo to use everywhere! :)</p>
<h2 id="a-tech-stack">A tech stack</h2>
<p>This was probably the part that held me off from working on this for the longest. For a long time, I was convinced that I would build my site using Vue.js, with the Vuetify component library, due to my prior experience with Vue. I also contemplated throwing in Nuxt in order to be able to server-side render some things. At some point, I realised that this was all extremely overkill, and would require actively running a server, which had many of its own costs.</p>
<h3 id="github-pages-and-dr-jekyll">GitHub Pages, and Dr Jekyll</h3>
<p>Once I realised that a static site would better suit my needs, I knew that I would use GitHub Pages for hosting. A friend of mine, ralismark, had mentioned how great Jekyll was, using it for <a href="https://www.ralismark.xyz" target="_blank">their own site</a>. I had known that Jekyll was a thing for a while, ever since I created my first GitHub Pages site in 2014, but had always ignored it, naively thinking that pure HTML/CSS was the way to go at the time.</p>

<p>After building this site with Jekyll, I have to say itâ€™s an absolute delight to work with. GitHub automatically builds a Jekyll site on push, and deploys it. Jekyll provides amazing templating support, reducing redundancy.Another fantastic feature is built-in support for writing pages and posts in Markdown (this is my first post in Markdown!! Hello world!!), for insertion into templates. While there are many Markdown-to-HTML converters out there, Jekyll just makes it seamless.</p>

<p>If I ever require a page with server-side rendering, I can always host that on a separate domain. ralismark still says that Jekyll is great, although he does wish that he could server-side render LaTeX so that he doesnâ€™t need to do that on the clientâ€™s device.</p>
<h3 id="frontend-frameworks">Frontend frameworks</h3>
<p><del>Admittedly as a result of me still being stuck in my old ways (or just being lazy), this site still uses jQuery in few places. I intend on porting it all to vanilla JavaScript at some point.</del> This site is now free of jQuery!  I also made the mistake of deciding to use Bootstrap when I started writing this site - mainly for layout (responsive containers), but you can probably see, this site looks relatively un-Bootstrapish. I also intend on removing Bootstrap at some point, since most of the layout stuff shouldnâ€™t be too hard to reimplement myself.</p>
<h2 id="fun-stuff">Fun stuff</h2>
<p>One of <a href="https://mango.pdf.zone" target="_blank">my favourite blogs</a>, by the legendary <a href="https://twitter.com/mangopdf">@mangopdf</a>, has a couple of easter eggs baked into it. I decided to take some inspiration and add some fun stuff too! At the moment, thereâ€™s only one easter egg, which youâ€™ll have to head to the homepage to learn about, but thereâ€™s definitely more coming soon!</p>

<p>I also eventually realised that mangopdfâ€™s blog uses Jekyll too, so I knew that I had made a good choice. ðŸ˜Ž</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>
<p>Well, I have quite a few posts planned, so watch this space I guess! ðŸ™ƒ</p>
